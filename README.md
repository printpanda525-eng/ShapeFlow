# ShapeFlow

**ShapeFlow** is a lightweight and professional Blender add-on focused on procedural shape creation and streamlined modeling workflows.

It is designed to improve speed, consistency, and control during common modeling tasks, especially in early and mid production stages.

ShapeFlow integrates naturally into Blender without altering scene units or forcing destructive operations.

## Workflow Philosophy

ShapeFlow is built around **flow-based modeling**, allowing artists to stay focused on form and structure.

Instead of heavy automation, ShapeFlow provides:
- Clear actions
- Minimal UI friction
- Results you can trust

The addon enhances Blender’s workflow without replacing it.
